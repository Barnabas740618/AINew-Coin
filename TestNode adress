As per my previous promise, I am releasing the test version of the AInew Node responsible for transactions of AInew coins. 
Based on the Swagger documentation, a successful POST request can be programmed.
The Test Node accepts the following wallet addresses:

AI06 1413 7219 3621 7596 9031 1249
AI41 0606 4675 0701 1667 6381 0372
AI44 6493 7350 8904 2293 7707 4542

These wallets are initially preloaded with 500 coins, but the balance may change depending on the successful requests sent.

Therefore, it is possible that you may encounter an error due to insufficient balance, with a response indicating that there
are not enough coins in the wallet. In such cases, it is advisable to choose another wallet as the sender, as the total num-
ber of coins does not change, only the coins move from one wallet to another.

Finally, the TestNode API documentation is available at:
https://ainew.fr:2026/swagger

I wish all curious visitors successful testing and smooth experience!

Supplement!

A few test users have been created for the website to test the transactions. Please note that the transaction of the coins' unique identifiers on the website is not yet functional, only balance management works.

However, the balance of the wallet is not visible yet. However, if the sent transaction page reloads without an error message, the transaction is successful!

The test users: Test_User_01 / password: Test_passw_01 Test_User_02 / password: Test_passw_02 Test_User_03 / password: Test_passw_03

I wish everyone successful transactions!
