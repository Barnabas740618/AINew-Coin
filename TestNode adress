As per my previous promise, I am releasing the test version of the AInew Node responsible for transactions of AInew coins. 
Based on the Swagger documentation, a successful POST request can be programmed.
The Test Node accepts the following wallet addresses:

Test_Wallet_1, Test_Wallet_2, Test_Wallet_3

These wallets are initially preloaded with 500 coins, but the balance may change depending on the successful requests sent.

Therefore, it is possible that you may encounter an error due to insufficient balance, with a response indicating that there
are not enough coins in the wallet. In such cases, it is advisable to choose another wallet as the sender, as the total num-
ber of coins does not change, only the coins move from one wallet to another.

Finally, the TestNode API documentation is available at:
https://ainew.fr:2026/swagger

I wish all curious visitors successful testing and smooth experience!
